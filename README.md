>**WARNING:** This is definitely a work in progress. Proceed at your own risk. This was created to satisfy an immediate need I had to list the contents of some 600+ files in a spreadsheet, so it doesn't handle a lot of issues that may arrise outside of it's original intent.

# f2s
Take a list of files and output their content to a spreadsheet file (CSV)

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install @levibeach/f2s -g
# navigate to the folder which holds the files you want to export
f2s
# watch it run!
# enjoy you new output.csv
```
## TODO
- [ ] Allow the user to specify a folder
- [ ] Allow the user to specify a separator indicator
- [ ] Support other formats than CSV
